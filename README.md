The Predictive Maintenance model for industrial equipment which utilizes IoT data is designed to forecast potential equipment failures before they occur, enhancing operational efficiency and minimizing downtime. Leveraging real-time sensor data from machinery, the model processes and analyzes critical parameters like voltage, rotation, pressure, vibration, and more. It applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of equipment failure, enabling proactive maintenance. 
In addition to predictive analysis, the model incorporates anomaly detection and real-time monitoring, allowing for immediate identification of irregular behavior. This system provides businesses with cost savings by optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing unplanned downtime, and improving overall equipment life cycle management.
